## Hello, I'm John!

- I live in Corfu, Greece 39°38'N/19°55'E.
- I'm a committed developer, full-time, full-stack. There's no time for marriage, kids or pets!
- My focus is on .NET Core and Angular.
- For the past twenty months, I've been working on a project for a travel office and within the next sixty days I plan to finish a book on ionic and provide mobile access to users of this application.
- Fun fact: I enjoy the sunshine, swimming and long walks in the nearby hills.
- Oct 2021 update: The above mentioned project is online since May 2021 with restricted access to authorized users only. Within the next month, it will be in a public repo, including integration tests for the backend.

## Languages and tools:
- .NET Core
