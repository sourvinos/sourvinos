## Hello, I'm John!

- My focus is on .NET Core and Angular.
- For the past twenty months, I've been working on a project for a travel office and within the next sixty days I plan to finish a book on ionic and provide mobile access to users of this application.
- Fun fact: I enjoy the sunshine, swimming and long walks in the nearby hills.
