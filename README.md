## Hello, I'm John!

- I live in Corfu, Greece 39°38'N/19°55'E.
- I'm a committed developer, full-time, full-stack. I don't have time for marriage, kids or pets!
- My focus is on .NET Core and Angular.
- I've been working on a project for a travel office. Next year (2024) it will be in its third year in production.
- Fun fact: The blank tiles in my contribution are not because I took time off, but because I was not working on the master branch!

## Languages and tools:
- .NET Core
- Angular
- HTML
- CSS
- A little Javascript!
- MySQL
- Postman
- Visual Studio Code
